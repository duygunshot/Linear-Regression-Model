# Linear-Regression-Model
A machine learning Linear Regression model using PyTorch and PyTorch neural network.
The model was trained to predict y if given X using Linear Regression y = aX + b
It will also save and load the model.
(This script will run on Nvdia CUDA, can be modified easily on CPU if needed)
This model was created using the tutorial https://www.learnpytorch.io/01_pytorch_workflow/
